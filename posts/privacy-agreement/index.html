<p>We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any information that personally identifies you within the mobile application.</p>

</h2>
<p>A. Tracking Technologies</p>
<p>We and our third party partners, affiliates, or analytics service providers use standard tracking technologies (like web beacons, SDKs, APIs, scripts and tags) to identify your computer/device, to “remember” things about your visit or your use of the Services (such as your preferences or a user name) and to help us understand things like, what pages and features you use and the games you play.</p>
<p>Such information may be linked to or combined with other personal information we process about you, such as your user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to your interests, providing and personalizing our Services including making our Services easier to use, and for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.</p>
<p>Please refer to guidance provided by your device manufacturer, operating system developer, or individual web browser if you would like help in managing your preferences with respect to tracking technologies used on our Services.</p>
<p>B. Interest-Based Advertising</p>
<p>Some of our Services employ ad-serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies to deliver interest-based advertising to you about third party products and services. We may via our third party advertising partners, also advertise our Services to you on third parties’ websites. You may also see our games advertised in other services (like on Facebook). After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of our Services.</p>
<p>When you play our games or otherwise use our apps, some third party tools (SDKs) integrated within our Services may collect and use certain information collected from your device for the purpose of ad display and optimization. Such information includes GAID (Google Advertising ID on Android devices) or IDFA (Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices), region (i.e. the location where a given language is used), geo-location information (with your consent) and IP address. This Policy does not govern our third-party advertising partners, as they have their own privacy policies, which are accessible using the links provided below. We have no access to or control over such third parties. In addition to identifiers, these third parties may also collect information relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
<li>Length of time an advertisement was visible;</li>
<li>Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and</li>
<li>Click-throughs (i.e. whether a click was made on the ad) and advertisement response.</li>
</ul>
<p>They use this information (alone or in combination with information they have collected about you when you use third party websites or services) to: (i) enable the technical delivery of ads to your device and to verify click-throughs and/or installs; (ii) provide you with more relevant ads about our Services (for example, to present you with an offer for one of our games you might enjoy); (iii) enable offer walls, which allow you to choose from various rewarded ad or market research offers; (iv) track results and measure the effectiveness of ads; and (iv) improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems. We recommend that you review our advertising partners&rsquo; privacy policies for more information, further details of which are set out below:</p>

<p>Please note: adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive advertisements, it only means the ads you do see will be less relevant to your interests. Our advertising partners will also still use your device’s advertising ID to serve you with ads that may be less relevant to you; for example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see the same ad from us). You may also reset the Advertising ID associated with your device by following instructions provided by your device manufacturer or operating system developer.</p>
<p>C. Analytics Technologies</p>
<p>We use our own game servers and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services.</p>
<p>For instance, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), on our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’ activity , and provide other services related to our Services’ activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit and whether you are a return visitor. The Services do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"   target="_blank">
    partner services</a> and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google, click <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"   target="_blank">
    here</a>.</p>
<p>For our mobile apps and games on iOS and Android, we use the services of Adjust GmbH (Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405 Berlin, Germany). We use the Adjust SDK (Software Development Kit) which is an analytics service that provides us the ability to obtain and collect statistical data on the usage of our games and apps so that we can better understand how our users are using our games and apps. For this purpose, Adjust processes mobile identifiers such as the IDFA, GAID or similar mobile identifiers. Adjust&rsquo;s privacy policy is available <a href="https://www.adjust.com/terms/privacy-policy/"   target="_blank">
    here</a>.</p>
<p>Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals. However, we provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking technologies to send you interest-based advertising as explained above.</p>

<p>California law also permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals. However, we provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking technologies to send you interest-based advertising as explained above.</p>
